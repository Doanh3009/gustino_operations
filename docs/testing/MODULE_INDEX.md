## 2026-07-20 status refinement

- MOD-04/MOD-07: employee sales detail now exposes daily revenue chart/table; KPI guide explains existing day-based calculations and uses the shared filters. Local/type/build passed; visual verification pending.
- MOD-10: manual sale-out remains confirmable; the corrected local fix defaults sub-kilogram entries to grams and marks unsellable packing residue without changing physical quantity. Menu SKUs are visibly separated. BUG-091 RPC migration-order drift is blocked pending direct schema approval.
- MOD-12/MOD-17: Admin purchasing is read-only and exports filtered Excel. Workbook-open verification pending.
- MOD-06/MOD-18: reverse-geocode providers now race within a client timeout longer than each provider bound; handler/source regressions pass, while physical HTTPS GPS remains pending.
- MOD-20: scoped overflow hardening, mobile-header logo removal and competition-table tablet/card treatment passed source/type regressions; Browser is unavailable for visual verification.

Priority rationale: MOD-02 is first because authorization failures can expose or mutate cross-role/cross-branch business data and invalidate every downstream module test.

- 2026-09-12 MOD-07: Added authorized Admin revoke/delete detail actions and employee reconciliation. Automated adapter and payroll/KPI regressions pass; 144 route/role checks pass. Signed-in database revoke/delete and visual QA remain pending; see test-cases/MOD-07-payslip-revoke-delete.md.

- 2026-09-12 MOD-07 extension: employee confirms own current published slip using separate timestamp/RPC. Adapter and UI/security contracts pass; full build pending. New confirmation migration unapplied; isolated database/phone confirmation QA pending.

- 2026-09-12 MOD-21 Messaging: new MessagesPage/lib/messages and standalone admin_employee_messages SQL implement Admin↔employee, Admin broadcast, participant-only SELECT and narrow send/read/history RPCs. Adapter + actual isolated PostgreSQL security/history tests and reachable-button audit pass. Production migration, release and signed-in desktop/mobile/realtime QA pending; see test-cases/MOD-21-messaging.md.


## 2026-09-12 - Supabase egress review only

- Source inventory completed; see SUPABASE_EGRESS_REVIEW_2026-09-12.md. User requested review before changes; no app/SQL/config/deploy edits.
- Source-confirmed excess refresh: Admin per-event whole-section, Report per-event whole-ledger, Today new sessions array triggers full snapshot history. Attendance branches/employees reads fan out. No fixed 2-3-second cloud timer or proven infinite effect loop found.
- Static review only; no runtime egress/regression/production tests claimed. Preserve full stock/revenue/payroll inputs.
- Next: user reviews diff fragments, then implement approved minimal changes and run targeted regression/request-count and byte measurements in isolation.

## 2026-09-12 - Egress regression evidence
- Actual behavior harness SUPABASE_EGRESS_REFRESH_OK passed after handling absent/partial payloads safely. Report complete snapshots and operation-day payloads now update local state without follow-up reads; joined/DELETE/partial ledger events debounce400ms.
- attendance-realtime-next-day produced identical nine failures on HEAD baseline; unrelated existing failure, not introduced. Legacy realtime-reminders requires literal8000 polling contrary to new authorized behavior; old test preserved and conflict documented in test-cases/MOD-20-supabase-egress-refresh.md.
- No production bytes/UI/multi-device claim. Build in progress. Next final build and diff-check, then deliver savings estimates and limitations.


## 2026-09-12 - Egress fixes final local handoff
- All six authorized changes implemented. Final SUPABASE_EGRESS_REFRESH_OK and diff-check pass; TypeScript and elevated full production build pass (733 modules; PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_BUNDLE_OK index-AqLpUzXF.js). Six relevant existing regressions pass. Legacy continuous-polling contract conflicts with explicit request; attendance-next-day nine failures are identical against HEAD baseline. No test expectations overwritten.
- Changed application files: TodayPage, KitchenPage, AdminPage, ReportPage, AttendancePage, SalesPage, lib/attendance, lib/supplyRequests. Added isolated behavior regression and MOD-20-supabase-egress-refresh.md case/estimate record; tracking updated throughout.
- Expected savings are per-flow request/row estimates, not measured production egress. Kitchen history still loads permitted full scope only while opened (and realtime updates while open); LAN server contract unchanged and active filtering local. No Supabase/schema/deploy/data write occurred.
- Next exact action: authorized frontend release, then signed-in two-device validation and request/byte before-after measurement including socket disconnect/rejoin, history close/open, scope changes, and stock/POS/report/attendance reliability. Existing separate timers outside the six requested targets remain for a later reviewed batch.
